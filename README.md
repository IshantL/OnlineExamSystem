* A one page dynamic quiz that tallys scores in an array.
* Client-side data validation
* A back button that remembers the users previous answers
* jQuery animations
* Store the questions in an external JSON file
* Uses cookies to remember users names.

Future changes I'd like to make:

* Handlebars intergration for cleaner HTML.
* Use a Node JS login system to store users and their scores in a db.
* Allow users to create their own quizzes and challenge friends.
